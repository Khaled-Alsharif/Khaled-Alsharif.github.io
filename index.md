## About Me

I am a Research Assitant and a Doctoral Candidate at Purdue University. My broad research area is Information Security. Since starting my Ph.D. at Purdue University, I have worked closely with Dr. Dongyan Xu and Dr. Z. Berkay Celik, where I focused on Automotive Security. I also have industrial research experience through working with Boeing as a Cyber Security Researcher, where I was involved in several security research projects pertaining to avionic networks, mesh networks, IoT devices, and other areas.
