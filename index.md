## About Me

I am a scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI). My broad research area is CPS security, especially automotive and ICS security.
Previously, I have worked at Purdue University as a research assistant, where I obtained my Ph.D. in August 2023. I also have industrial research experience through working with Boeing as a cyber security researcher, where I was involved in several security research projects pertaining to avionic networks, mesh networks, IoT devices, and other areas. 


## Research Interests

- **Network Security:** Serial Buses, Mesh Networks, Ethernet, Wireless Networks

- **Cyber Physical Systems Security:** ICS security, Automotive Systems, Autonomous Vehicles, Avionic Systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), IoT Devices
